# Item-Exchange-Simulator
This financial application is a personal project that handles sequential trades in a way that prioritizes the best deal possible. It does so using a priority heap implemented using linked lists. I coded this project during a time before I learned the intracasies of data structures and I'm looking forward to updating the code vigorly when port it over to C++. That said, it does what it intended really well. I tried to recreate an item exchange system in a game from my youth and this program recreates the experience as I know it completely. It just reminds me what my favorite past of studying CS has been so far: To be able to look at something that has been completely abstracted away and instantly have an idea of how they implement it. Anyways, I hope you enjoy my project. I'm looking forward to adding many great ones
 to my github in the future.
